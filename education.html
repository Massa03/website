                <h6 class="class-title">CS 280</h6>
                <p class="class-text">Conceptual study of programming language syntax, semantics and implementation. Course covers language definition structure, data types and structures, control structures and data flow, run-time consideration, and interpretative languages.</p>
                <h6 class="class-title">CS 114 </h6>
                <p class="class-text">A study of advanced programming topics with logical structures of data, their physical representation, and the design of computer algorithms operating on the structures. Course covers program specifications, correctness and efficiency, data abstraction, and algorithm analysis. </p>
                <h6 class="class-title">CS 113</h6>
                <p class="class-text"> Intensive introduction to computer science. Problem-solving decomposition. Writing, debugging, and analyzing computer programs. Introduction to arrays and lists. Iteration and recursion. The Java language is introduced and used to highlight these concepts. </p>
                <h6 class="class-title">CS 241</h6>
                <p class="class-text">An introduction to the foundations of computer science with emphasis on the development of techniques for the design and proof of correctness of algorithms and the analysis of their computational complexity. Reasoning techniques based on propositional and predicate logic and relational calculus operations with applications to databases will also be introduced. Auxiliary topics such as combinatorics of finite sets, functions and relations, and graph-theory definitions and graph storage alternatives will also be examined. </p>
                <h6 class="class-title">CS 332 </h6>
                <p class="class-text">Organization of operating systems covering structure, process management and scheduling; interaction of concurrent processes; interrupts; I/O, device handling; memory and virtual memory management and file management.</p>
                <h6 class="class-title">IS 117</h6>
                <p class="class-text">This course discusses the concepts and skills required to plan, design and build websites. It will
                    be taught in a lab to ensure hands-on experience with each of these tasks. The course begins with
                    an overview of web technologies. Students learn to plan websites, which includes determining
                    the business and end-user requirements for the site. Design includes learning to develop
                    "mockups" of how the site will look and how people will use it. The major tools for building
                    websites will be industry standard HTML and XHTML to describe web page content, and
                    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for flexibly formatting the content.
                </p>
                <h6 class="class-title">CS 100</h6>
                <p class="class-text">An introduction to programming and problem-solving skills using Python or other very high level language. Topics include basic strategies for problem solving, constructs that control the flow of execution of a program and the use of high level data types such as lists, strings and dictionaries in problem representation. The course also presents an overview of selected topics in computing, such as networking and databases.</p>
